# Projector clock

A minimalistic, non-distracting projector clock I made for proctoring when I was a teaching assistant. 
Currently, some things are still hard-wired, but it can already be useful nevertheless.
The background is black, because projectors don't emit light then, minimising the distraction.
Aside from the clock, also a notes section is featured, allowing you to write down instructions
for the students taking the exam.

**Don't forget to enter fullscreen for the full minimalism, non-distraction effect!**

I've used it in a couple of proctoring sessions, and even in a room where the clock was visible enough,
the students preferred this big digital clock. You can click on the long note to edit its content.

Available keyboard functions:
- [1]: show/hide short note
- [2]: show/hide long note
- [r]: reset contents of long note
- [f] or browser-specific [F11]: fullscreen
