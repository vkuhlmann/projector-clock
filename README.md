# Projector clock

A minimalistic, non-distracting projector clock I made for proctoring when I was a teaching assistant.
The background is black, because projectors don't emit light there, minimising the distraction.
Aside from the clock, also a notes section is featured, allowing you to write down instructions
for the students taking the exam.

**Don't forget to enter fullscreen for the full minimalism, non-distraction effect!**

I've used it in a couple of proctoring sessions, and even in a room where the clock was visible enough,
the students preferred this big digital clock. You can click on the long note to edit its content.

Available keyboard functions:
- [1]: show/hide short note
- [2]: show/hide long note
- [h]: show/hide help toolbar
- [f] or browser-specific [F11]: fullscreen

Things I would still like to add when I've a bit of time:
- Allow clock font size change.
- Auto-hide help toolbar after a couple of seconds.
- Allow note font size change.
- Add dual column layout.
- Rename sessions.
- Delete and rename sessions from within the dropdown.
- Automatically adapt font to fit contents in screen.
- Editing in one browser window, and pushing it automatically to another browser window.
