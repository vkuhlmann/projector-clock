# Projector clock

A minimalistic, non-distracting projector clock I made for proctoring when I was a teaching assistant.
The background is black, because projectors don't emit light there, minimising the distraction.
Aside from the clock, also a notes section is featured, allowing you to write down instructions
for the students taking the exam.

**Don't forget to enter fullscreen for the full minimalism, non-distraction effect!**

I've used it in a couple of proctoring sessions, and even in a room where the clock was visible enough,
the students preferred this big digital clock. I provided useful information using the notes, as demonstrated
in the new session template. Click notes to edit them.

Available keyboard functions:
- [1]: show/hide first note
- [2]: show/hide second note
- [1..9]: show/hide #-th note
- [h]: show/hide help toolbar
- [f] or browser-specific [F11]: fullscreen

Things I would still like to add when I've a bit of time:
- Add clock font size changing.
- Auto-hide help toolbar after a couple of seconds.
- Add session duplication and overwriting.
- Add note font size changing.
- Add option for dual column layout.
- Add session renaming.
- Allow session delete and rename from within the dropdown.
- Add option to have font size auto adapt to fit all contents in the screen.
- Add frequent check for cookie updates, so you can edit in one browser window, and by overwriting the session of another browser window, the changes will appear seamlessly in your presenting browser window.
